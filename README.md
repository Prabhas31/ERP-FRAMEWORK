# 📱 Emergency Phone Recovery Framework (ERP Framework)

## 🔥 Project Overview
The Emergency Phone Recovery Framework (ERP Framework) is an Android-based mobile security system designed to help users recover lost or stolen smartphones. It provides a secure, database-driven approach to device tracking, authentication, and recovery.

The system ensures that even after reinstallation or unauthorized access, the device can be tracked and controlled securely.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Mobile theft and loss are increasing rapidly, and existing solutions often lack a proper database-driven recovery system. Most applications fail to provide:

- Secure recovery mechanisms  
- Persistent tracking after reinstall  
- Strong authentication layers  
- Structured device ownership verification  

This project solves these issues by implementing a secure and structured recovery framework using modern mobile technologies.
